					<p>Candy coating chocolate, also known as compound chocolate or confectionery coating, is a type of chocolate that is made with vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter. This gives it a smooth texture and allows it to be melted and used for coating candy and other treats.</p>
          				<p>Candy coating chocolate typically has a lower percentage of cocoa solids than traditional chocolate, ranging from about 20% to 50%. It also contains sugar, milk powder, and other ingredients that give it a sweet flavor and creamy texture. It is available in a variety of colors and flavors, making it popular for creating colorful and fun confections.</p>
          				<p>One advantage of candy coating chocolate is that it is easier to work with than traditional chocolate. It melts more easily and doesn't require tempering, which can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Candy coating chocolate also has a longer shelf life than traditional chocolate and can be stored at room temperature without the risk of blooming or melting.</p>
          				<p>While candy coating chocolate is a popular choice for candy making and decorating, it is not considered real chocolate due to the absence of cocoa butter. However, it can be a delicious and convenient alternative for those who want to create sweet treats at home.</p>
