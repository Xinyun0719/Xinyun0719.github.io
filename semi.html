					<p>Semi-sweet chocolate is a type of chocolate that is characterized by its balance of sweetness and bitterness. It is made by combining cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and sugar, with varying amounts of each ingredient depending on the specific recipe.</p>
          				<p>Semi-sweet chocolate typically contains a higher percentage of cocoa solids than milk chocolate, usually around 50% to 70%, although this can vary by brand and recipe. This higher percentage of cocoa solids gives semi-sweet chocolate a richer, more complex flavor profile with a slightly bitter taste.</p>
          				<p>Semi-sweet chocolate is often used in baking and cooking, as it pairs well with a variety of other ingredients and can add depth and complexity to dishes. It can be used to make cakes, cookies, brownies, and other desserts, as well as savory dishes like mole sauce and chili.</p>
          				<p>Semi-sweet chocolate is also often enjoyed on its own as a snack or treat, and can be found in a variety of forms, including bars, chips, and chunks. When choosing a semi-sweet chocolate, look for high-quality brands that use sustainable and ethical sourcing practices and have a good balance of sweetness and bitterness for optimal flavor.</p>
