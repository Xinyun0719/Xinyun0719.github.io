					<p>Unsweetened chocolate, also known as baking chocolate or bitter chocolate, is a pure form of chocolate that contains no added sugar or sweeteners. It is made from cocoa solids, which are derived from roasted cocoa beans. These solids are then ground into a fine powder, which is used to make unsweetened chocolate.</p>
          <p>Because it contains no sugar or other sweeteners, unsweetened chocolate has a bitter and intense flavor that can be overpowering if eaten on its own. However, it is an important ingredient in many recipes for baked goods and desserts, where it is used to add depth and complexity to the flavor of the final product.</p>
          <p>Unsweetened chocolate is also a good source of antioxidants, which are beneficial compounds that can help to protect the body against oxidative stress and other forms of damage. It is also relatively low in calories and carbohydrates, which makes it a popular choice for people who are following a low-carb or low-sugar diet.</p>
          <p>Overall, unsweetened chocolate is an important ingredient in many recipes and has a distinct flavor and nutritional profile that sets it apart from other types of chocolate.</p>
